# deep_learning_birdsong_classification

Final project for the course *Deep Learning - metoder och tillämpningar* at Umeå University.     


The project's objective was to explore deep learning models for classifying birds by their birdsong.   
The background, implementation process, and the results are documented in the report pdf. The code is available in the three ipynb files, where one notebook is used to explore the raw dataset, one notebook is used to create the preprocessed dataset by feature extraction, and one notebook is used for defining, training, and evaluating the deep learning models.
